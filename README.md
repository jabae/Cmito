# Cmito: Mitochondria detection in *C*. *elegans* EM images

*Cmito* is a tool that enables dense reconstruction of mitochondria in *C*. *elegans* electron microscopy (EM) image stacks using convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Setup
```
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jabae/Cmito.git
cd Cmito

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements
```

## *Cmito* pipeline
![](figures/mito_detection.png)

### Mitochondria prediction
```
python Cmito/detect_nucleus.py --image [test_data/test_image.png] --model [models/nucleus_model.chkpt] --output [output_path.tif]
```
- Supports image files in tif, png, h5, cloudvolume images.

#### Mitochondria prediction models
- `models/dataset2_model25000.chkpt`: Trained on EM images from Witvliet et al. (2021)[^1] Dataset 2. 
- `models/dataset5_model104000.chkpt`: Trained on EM images from Witvliet et al. (2021)[^1] Dataset 5. 
- `models/dataset6_model166000.chkpt`: Trained on EM images from Witvliet et al. (2021)[^1] Dataset 6. 
- `models/dataset8_model122000.chkpt`: Trained on EM images from Witvliet et al. (2021)[^1] Dataset 8. 
- `models/dauer_model188000.chkpt`: Trained on EM images from Yim et al. (2021)[^2] dauer dataset.

*Select appropriate model that your image is similar to the images each model has been trained on.

### Mitochondria segmentation
```
python Cmito/segment_nucleus.py --mito [test_data/test_mito.tif] --output [output_path.tif]
```
- Supports image files in tif, png, h5, cloudvolume images.

*[ ] are variables users can specify. Currently, the variables point to the test data.
